        <h3>Daivathinte Charanmar</h3>
        
        <p>This book is a collection of Author's memories.. Nothing about super hero life incidents,But simple, normal life. I think through this book he is trying to convey that everyone's life, there will be an influencer, may be more than one - and he is calling them as god's spies (Daivathinte Charanmar).The book is divided into several chapters, some chapters will bring joy, some others will bring thoughts, and there are some chapters I felt like totally irrelevant as well. But for sure, after completing this book, readers will reiterate some of their own life incidents, and realize their god's spies</p>
