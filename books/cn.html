        <h3>Computer Networks, 6e</h3>
        
        <p>In Computer Networks, Tanenbaum et al. explain how networks work from the inside out. They start with the physical layer of networking, computer hardware and transmission systems, then work their way up to network applications. Each chapter follows a consistent approach: The book presents key principles, then illustrates them utilizing real-world example networks that run through the entire book – the Internet, and wireless networks, including Wireless LANs, broadband wireless, and Bluetooth. The 6th Edition is updated throughout to reflect the most current technologies, and the chapter on network security is rewritten to focus on modern security principles and actions.

            Features:
            
            1.)NEW - Coverage of modern cellular architectures includes 4G and 5G networks to reflect the most current technology.
            
            2.) NEW - Ethernet and wireless networks material, specifically 40- and 100-gigabit Ethernet, 802.11.ac, 802.11ad, and 802.11ax, have been added.
            
            3.) NEW - Emerging technology discussions cover topicssuch as virtualization and SDN.
            
            4.) UPDATED - Audio and video streaming technology discussions include MPEG-DASH.
            
            5.)UPDATED - Additional readings suggested to expand students’ understanding.</p>
