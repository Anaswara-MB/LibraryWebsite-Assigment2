        <h3>Artificial Life Models in Software</h3>
        
        <p>The advent of powerful processing technologies and the advances in software development tools have
            drastically changed the approach and implementation of computational research in fundamental properties 
            of living systems through simulating and synthesizing biological entities and processes in artificial media.
             Nowadays realistic physical and physiological simulation of natural and would-be creatures, worlds and societies 
             becomes a low-cost task for ordinary home computers. The progress in technology has dramatically reshaped the structure
              of the software, the execution of a code, and visualization fundamentals. This has led to the emergence of novel breeds
               of artificial life software models, including three-dimensional programmable simulation environment, distributed 
               discrete events platforms and multi-agent systems. This second edition reflects the technological and research advancements, 
               and presents the best examples of artificial life software models developed in the World and available for users.</p>
