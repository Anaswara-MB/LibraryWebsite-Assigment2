        <h3>Mind Games</h3>
        
        <p>Preethi might have killed someone and gotten away with it.
            If only she could remember whom.
            Preethi Ratnam, computer science student, dreams of a blood-covered face night after night. She needs to know if she's a killer before it happens again. The new chief medical officer at her father's mental health clinic is the only one who takes her fears seriously.
            Dr Shekhar has his own secrets. The eminent psychiatrist plans to destroy the other business owned by Preethi's father-a state-of-the-art drug testing centre. Sleaze, greed, corruption... the centre's stellar reputation conceals many sins, including the loss of someone very dear to Shekhar. When all his plots to infiltrate the centre fail, Shekhar finds one weapon: Preethi, with her clout as the owner's daughter and her expertise in computers.
            What Shekhar encounters is much bigger than what he expected. Family secrets, a daughter who committed suicide, rumours of mental illness, employees who vanished. There is also the beautiful and mysterious Dr Nandini, the second-in-command in the business. Is she another of the pawns in the game? Or is she someone with her own game to play?
            Then, a second blood-soaked body is discovered in the drug testing centre. Shekhar needs to figure out what happened before one more innocent life is harmed in the ruthless mind games staged at the drug testing centre.
            Mind Games is an exciting mystery thriller set in Chennai. If you enjoy complicated protagonists and twisty plots, you will love Shekhar and Preethi's plunge into peril. Grab your copy today!</p>
